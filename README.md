# Sudoku

A small project to try to make a program to solve sudoku puzzles

It started a few years ago as a introductory project in order to learn a bit of C

I wanted to make a cleaner version in Python

**Author:** Eduardo Barrancos

## C Version

sudoku_solver_old.c was an old project to make a Sudoku solver using C

Due to my lack of inexperience it is not the best program efficiency wise neither cleaness wise, but, at the time, I gave it my best shot.

### Usage

To insert the puzzle intended to be solved open [the c file](c-version/soduku_solver_old.c) and change the "sudoku" matrix. All blank spaces should have '0' instead.

Then, inside the [c-version folder](c-version) run the *"make"* command to compile or *"make debug"* to compile and debug and *"make run"* to compile and run.

The *"make clean"* can be used to clean the binary file.

## Python Version

**In progress**
